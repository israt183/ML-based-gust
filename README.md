# ML-based-gust
Hi I am Israt, a PhD student in the Environmental Engineering Department of UConn. 
I am a machine learning enthusiast and currently working on a project that aims to 
improve wind gust prediction of WRF model by incorporating ML alogorithms. I have 
applied Random Forest, XGBoost and Generalized Linear Models in my work so far. This 
is an ongoing project and I use multiple scripts for different purposes. I have 
attached only a few scripts here. I am doing leave-one-storm cross validation and 
using density plots, feature importance plots and spatial variability plots for 
better visualization. Reach out to me @ israt.jahan@uconn.edu if you want to know 
more about the project or want to collaborate on something!
