# ML-based-gust
Hi I am Israt, PhD student in the Environmental Engineering department of UConn.
I am courrently working on a project that aims to improve wind gust prediction of WRF model by incorporating ML alogorithms.
This is an ongoing project and I have been using different scripts for multiple purposes.
I have only added a few scripts that I frequently use.
The script LOSO_RF_UPP_as_feature_density_plot.py is used to perform leave-one-storm CV and to make 2D historgram plots.
The script FI_RF_Tuned.py is used to make permutation feature importance plots by changing the test storms over 
n iterations where n is the number of storms in the dataset. 
I will add scripts to make spatial error plots for individual weather stations and to generate learning curves which shows how much the evaluation metrics improve by the addition of more storms.
