# ML-based-gust
Hi I am Israt, a PhD student in the Environmental Engineering department of UConn.
I am courrently working on a project that aims to improve wind gust prediction of WRF model by incorporating ML alogorithms.
This is an ongoing project and I have been using different scripts for multiple purposes. I have attached only a few scripts here.
I am doing leave-one-storm cross validation and using density plots, feature importance plots and spatial variability plots for better visualization.
Reach out to me @ israt.jahan@uconn.edu if you want to know more about the project or want to collaborate on something!
