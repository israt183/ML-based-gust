# ML-based-gust
Hi I am Israt, PhD student in the Environmental Engineering department of UConn.
I am courrently working on a project that aims to improve wind gust prediction of WRF model by incorporating ML alogorithms.
This is an ongoing project and I have been using different scripts for multiple purposes.
I have only added a few scripts that I frequently use.
